# Evolving Maps
## Olivier van Holthe tot Echten

This program is designed to provide insight into genetic algorithms (GA). Its purposes are: 
* to show that GA's can be applied in a wide range of problems. 
* to show step by step how such an algorithm works. 

The problem of map coloring allows for some clear definitions of parameters and protocols 
used in a GA. That makes it very useful for a simple explanation of an abstract and difficult mechanism. 
The program will guide you through the steps of a genetic algorithm and shows how different elements of 
map coloring correspond to the elements of evolution. In the end an animation is displayed to show how 
parts of DNA are used to create new individuals.
