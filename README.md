# Evolving Maps
## Olivier van Holthe tot Echten

This program is designed to provide insight into genetic algorithms (GA). Its purposes are: 
* to show that GA's can be applied in a wide range of problems. 
* to show step by step how such an algorithm works. 

The problem of map coloring allows for some clear definitions of parameters and protocols 
used in a GA. That makes it very useful for a simple explanation of an abstract and difficult mechanism.
